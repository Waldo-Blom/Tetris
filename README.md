# Tetris
This repo is used by me to learn Typescript and Svelte

## How to run project
1. Intall the dependencies with `npm install`
2. To run in debug mode use the command `npm run dev` and open the link created in the browser
## Logical fixes to be made
- [ ] Blocks overlap when the down arrow is used too fast
-- This is not due to the down fuction maybe??The problem lies within the merge board logic, the merged piece is not added to the new board for some reason???
-- The problem also occurs with the left and right



- [ ] Game over screen is not visible when the match is over
- [ ] Game feels a bit to slow??

## UI and Navigation changes
- [ ] Update the colors of the shapes to make it look more appealing.
- [ ] Add a highscore score board before you start & add a start button
- [ ] Change the screen to look like an gameboy screen
